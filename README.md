2. **Problem Statement:**

Service assurance systems must detect and ideally predict Service Level Agreement violations in order to prevent degraded user experience. The reference paper [Predicting SLA Violations in Real Time using Online Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01386) proposes a service-agnostic online learning approach that predicts whether a client-side SLA is currently violated based on server-side device statistics. The model learns system behavior incrementally from streaming metrics and adapts under changing load patterns qwhich is called **concept drift**. However, the original work focuses on real-time detection. It is predicting whether the SLA is violated or not at the current moment. The limitations: (i) the problem is framed as a binary classification of the current state, (ii) there is no discussion of predicting a future time horizon ($t+1$, $t+2$, ...), (iii) it focuses on instantaneous classification rather than early warning.
