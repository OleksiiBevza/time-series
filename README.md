My solution for the task: Predictive alerting for cloud metrics.

The dataset can be found under: [dataset](https://mldata-static.ml.tu-berlin.de/repository/data/viewslug/realm-im2015-vod-traces/index.html)


The repository consist from:

1. folder "LITERATURE" where all more or less relevant articles/papers are stored;

2. word document "summary" where some articles and ideas are summarized;

3. helpers.py file where functions for preprocessing are defined;

4. modelling.ipynb file where the solution for the task can be found;

5. 1_EDA_all_columns.txt is just a report generated to improve readability of the data
